## Purpose
the idea is to create a distribured artifical intelligence training platform with security through redundancy, as well as technologies such as homomorphic encryption and intel SGX.
The reason for constructing such a system being the equal access to be able to influence the tools that will come to control or influence every aspect of our lives as artificial intelligence networks become ever more advanced

## Evidence of need
A distributed system such is this standard to represent an equality of access, and aims to collect resources to compete with privately owned systems such as google, and amazon, that if left uncheck will allow a hyper minority of epople to make, often illinformed decisions on behalf of billions of people
